I am a first-year Ph.D. student specializing in novel oral biomaterials in the Department of Prosthodontics at Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology. I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor Xuliang Deng and Assistant Professor Binbin Lai(https://laiblab.github.io/). My research interests focus on the tri-lineage differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and the performance prediction of oral biomaterials.
